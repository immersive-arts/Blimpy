## Introduction

Blimpy is a framework for the realization of immersive spatial augmented reality experiences with autonomous helium blimps. The framework allows artists and designers to develop their own creative language by designing the blimpsâ€™ shape, behavior and the audiovisual content for the overall appearance. It is designed to be mostly transparent to those creatives that prefer to focus on aesthetic aspects, but approachable for those that wish to engage with the technical details.
