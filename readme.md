## Introduction

Blimpy is a framework for the realization of immersive spatial augmented reality experiences with autonomous helium blimps. The framework allows artists and designers to develop their own creative language by designing the blimps’ shape, behavior and the audiovisual content for the overall appearance. It is designed to be mostly transparent to those creatives that prefer to focus on aesthetic aspects, but approachable for those that wish to engage with the technical details.

## Repository

This repository contains all the info needed to get started making your own blimp.
