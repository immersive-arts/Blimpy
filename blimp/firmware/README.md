TODO: MQTT protocol description...

## Compilation and Installation

#### Install NAOS CLI:

[https://naos.shiftr.io/quickstart](https://naos.shiftr.io/quickstart)

(installation via terminal app, no need to create any folder, the installer will install the app into /usr/local/bin)

inside terminal, cd to the folder where this readme is located, like:

```bash
cd /Users/XXX/blimpy/drone/firmware/
```

### Python Dependency:

Python 2.7 or higher needs to be installed.

pyserial for python 2.x:
```bash
pip install pyserial
```

#### Install naos dependencies and compile:

```bash
naos install
naos build
```

Attach board to usb connector.

Switch on board.

Run firmware:

(naos run makes a build, flash, attach in this sequence:)

```bash
naos run
```

## Configuration of device - OSX ONLY:

Install [shiftr.io Desktop](https://desktop.shiftr.io) to get access to the BLE configuration.

shiftr.io will be inside the menu bar after start.

when a device is switched on, shiftr.io will detect the device if bluetooth is enabled.

connect to device:

menu > shitfr.io > 1(2..) Device > deviceName

![wifi](../../assets/pix/firmware/BT_deviceConfig_Wifi.jpg)

* SSID: Network deviceName
* Password: Network password
* Boot Factory: deprecated
* Ping: status LED of the pinged device flashes white

![mqtt](../../assets/pix/firmware/BT_deviceConfig_MQTT.jpg)

* Host: broker IP
* Port: broker Port (1883 default port for * MQTT brokers, i.e. mosquitto)
* Client ID: this device ID
* Username: broker Username
* Password: broker password
* Use shiftr.io: autocomplete for shiftr.io broker
