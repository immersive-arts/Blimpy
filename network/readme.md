## Running the application
### Prerequisites
The manager requires an instance of shiftr.io as a MQTT broker. A straight-forward option is to run the broker on the same machine as the manager (TODO: instructions?). In addition, the motion capture system needs to be operational and a NATNET to OSC translator should provide motion capture data in OSC format (for more information, check [https://github.com/tecartlab/app_NetNatThree2OSC](https://github.com/tecartlab/app_NetNatThree2OSC).
